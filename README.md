# Numerical Methods

### Numerical Methods Implementations

Inspired by a university course by the same name, _Numerical Methods_ can calculate and solve tasks similar to those given in class.

The project is based on RESTful API Microservice architecture, where each Microservice is dedicated to a different field of Numerical Methods.


## The Microservices
* **Errors** (Python & Flask): The simplest Microservice, can calculate absolute error, relative error, and a given function's effect on the output.

* **Interpolations** (Go & Chi): Supports Newton's method and Vandermonde method. Uses _Polynomials_ and _LinearEquations_ Microservices for its functionality.
More methods will be implemented in the future.
